- Reworked folder and CSS file names to match Inter 4.0 and improve compatability
  - **This will likely have broken your CSS or font file imports**
- Reworked some ont-family names match Inter 4.0 and improve compatability
  - This **may** have broken your CSS font file declarations
- Currently the web hinted woff files are missing from Inter's relase archive. These will be added when they are available.
